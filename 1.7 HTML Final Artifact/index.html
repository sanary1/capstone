    <h1> Winter break Lake Tahoe recap</h1>
    <p> Over winter break I was able to celebrate my birthday and the new years in Lake Tahoe by skiing with my family and eating at Hell's Kitchen </p>
    <div class="section">
    <h2> Skiing at Heavenly </h2>
    <p> I went skiing at Heavenly with my family for my birthday. It was a lot of fun.</p>

    <p> Although the drive back was long, it was a great trip to Lake Tahoe, and I can't wait to go back!</p>
